### Hi there, I'm Samuel ðŸ‘‹

### About me
I'm a product-minded web3 engineer, currently focused on smart contract development, learning new technologies, and building apps on-chain. I have a keen interest in DeFi, Payments, ZK, Rollups, Modular, and Appchains. The technologies I work with include Solidity, Rust, Typescript, and NextJS. In my free time, I love to travel and explore new places.
