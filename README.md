### Hi there, I'm Samuel ðŸ‘‹

I'm a product-minded web3 engineer who loves building apps on-chain. Currently focused on smart contract development and learning new technologies, I have a keen interest in DeFi, Payments, ZK, Rollups, Modular, and Appchains. The technologies and frameworks I work with include Solidity, Rust, Typescript, Yul, Foundry, Anchor and NextJS.
